## Project Overview

- Two Laravel frontend servers:
  - FE1: `54.176.172.183:9091`
  - FE2: `54.176.56.42:9092`
- Apache reverse proxy server (load balancer): `54.176.139.180`
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys code on both frontends when changes are pushed to GitHub.

Requests to the proxy server (`54.176.139.180`) are distributed in a round-robin fashion to FE1 and FE2.

### Rendered Diagram Description:
- **GitHub Repo** triggers **Jenkins** via a webhook.
- **Jenkins** deploys to both FE1 and FE2.
- FE1 and FE2 are both Laravel apps running on different ports.
- The **Apache Load Balancer** (on port 80) distributes requests to FE1 and FE2 in round-robin fashion.
